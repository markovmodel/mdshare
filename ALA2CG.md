## Contents
The molecule and system setup is essentially the same as in [the other alanine dipeptide dataset](../ALA2#alanine-dipeptide). The major difference is that we cropped out the five backbone atoms (ACE-C ALA-N ALA-CA ALA-C NME-N) and recorded the coordinates and forces of them. The dataset contains four independent simulations, each of which consists of 250,000 frames (500 ns sampled with a 2-ps interval).
Therefore, for cross-validation it is recommended to separate the data into four folds by indexing the arrays with **[250000 * i_fold:250000 * (i_fold + 1)]**.

### Raw data
Shared PDB topology file, coordinates (key **coords**) and forces (key **aaFs**) on the five backbone atoms from four independent simulations (four trajectories were concatenated together **numpy.ndarray(shape=[1000000, 5, 3], dtype=numpy.float32)**). The unit of coordinates is Angstrom (0.1 nm) and for the forces kcal/(mol&middot;Angstrom).
